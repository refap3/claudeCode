# Conway's Game of Life

A terminal-based implementation of Conway's Game of Life created by qwen2.5-coder:14b on novita.ai.

## Description

This is a Python implementation of Conway's Game of Life, a cellular automaton that simulates the evolution of cells based on simple rules. The simulation uses a 50x50 grid with an initial density of 30% alive cells.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

## How to Run

```bash
cd qen2.5/life
python main.py
```

## Rules

1. Any live cell with fewer than 2 live neighbors dies (underpopulation)
2. Any live cell with 2 or 3 live neighbors survives
3. Any live cell with more than 3 live neighbors dies (overpopulation)
4. Any dead cell with exactly 3 live neighbors becomes alive (reproduction)

## Known Issues

- **The simulation runs too fast**: The main loop (line 48) needs a delay between generations. Add `import time` at the top and `time.sleep(0.1)` after `print_grid(grid)` to slow down the animation.
- No way to exit gracefully - use Ctrl+C to stop the program

## Display

- `O` represents a living cell
- `.` represents a dead cell
