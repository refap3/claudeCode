# Claude Code Experiments

A collection of terminal-based Python games and simulations created with Claude Code.

## Projects

### 🎮 [Racing Game](./racing)

A terminal-based first-person arcade racing game (like OutRun) with physics-based car movement on an oval track.

- First-person perspective rendering with track curvature
- Real-time physics simulation with velocity, acceleration, and friction
- Lap timing and tracking system
- Arrow key controls with intuitive handling
- Curses-based terminal rendering

**Quick start:**
```bash
cd racing
python3 racing_game.py
```

### 🔬 [Conway's Game of Life](./life)

A terminal implementation of Conway's Game of Life with interactive controls and visualization.

- Fast NumPy-based grid computation
- Multiple classic patterns (gliders, oscillators, spaceships, and more)
- Interactive keyboard controls for real-time manipulation
- Adjustable speed and grid size

**Quick start:**
```bash
cd life
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```

### 🚀 [Space Shooter](./space)

A classic arcade-style space shooter game with dynamic difficulty scaling.

- Progressive difficulty that increases as lives decrease
- Lives system with miss tracking (5 misses = 1 life lost)
- Dynamic enemy spawn rates and speeds
- Score tracking and game over screen
- Built with Pygame

**Quick start:**
```bash
cd space
pip install pygame
python3 space3.py
```

### 🚗 [Novita Games](./novita)

Two pygame games generated by `qooba/qwen3-coder-30b-a3b-instruct:q3_k_m` running via Ollama on novita.ai (RTX 5090).

- **`car.py`**: Top-down car racing — dodge traffic, earn points, survive
- **`battle.py`**: Vertical space shooter with OOP architecture and procedural sound effects

**Quick start:**
```bash
cd novita
pip install pygame
python car.py      # Car racing
python battle.py   # Space shooter
```

### 🧩 [Sudoku Solver](./sudokusolver)

A human-strategy Sudoku solver with both a terminal tutor and a full pygame GUI.

- `sudoku_gui.py`: Pygame GUI with interactive step-by-step navigation
  - 9×9 grid with candidate (pencilmark) display
  - Step-by-step navigation with colour-coded strategy highlights (placement/elimination/house)
  - Live conflict detection — invalid cells highlighted in red as you type
  - Puzzle input mode and load/save via in-window dialogs
  - Auto-play, brute-force fallback when human strategies are exhausted
- `sudoku_tutor.py`: Terminal solver — same human strategies with plain-English explanations
  - Strategies from beginner (Full House, Naked/Hidden Singles) through advanced (X-Wing, Swordfish, Y-Wing, XYZ-Wing, Simple Coloring)
- `sudosolv.py`: Simple backtracking solver

**Quick start:**
```bash
cd sudokusolver
pip install pygame
python sudoku_gui.py            # GUI (loads sd0.txt by default)
python sudoku_gui.py puzzle.txt # GUI with a specific puzzle
python sudoku_tutor.py sd0.txt  # terminal tutor
python sudoku_tutor.py sd0.txt --auto   # non-interactive full log
```

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- For racing game: curses library (standard on Unix/macOS, requires windows-curses on Windows)
- For Game of Life: numpy
- For space shooter / novita games: pygame
